## Memphis.dev
**[Memphis{dev}](https://memphis.dev)** is an open-source real-time data processing platform<br>
that provides end-to-end support for in-app streaming use cases using Memphis distributed message broker.<br>
Memphis' platform requires zero ops, enables rapid development, extreme cost reduction, <br>
eliminates coding barriers, and saves a great amount of dev time for data-oriented developers and data engineers.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Why
Working with data streaming is HARD.<br>

As a developer, you need to build a dedicated pipeline for each data source,<br>
work with schemas, formats, serializations, analyze each source individually,<br>
enrich the data with other sources, constantly change APIs, and scale for better performance ü•µ.<br>
Besides that, it constantly crashes and requires adaptation to different rate limits.<br>
**It takes time and resources that you probably don't have.**<br>

Message broker acts as the middleman and supports streaming architecture,<br>
but then you encounter Apache Kafka and its documentation and run back to the monolith and batch jobs.<br>
**Give memphis{dev} a spin before.**

## üëâ Use-cases
- Async task management
- Real-time streaming pipelines
- Data ingestion
- Cloud Messaging
  - Services (microservices, service mesh)
  - Event/Data Streaming (observability, analytics, ML/AI)
- Queuing
- N:N communication patterns

To access Memphis using UI/CLI/SDK from localhost, run the below commands:

  - kubectl port-forward service/memphis-cluster 6666:6666 9000:9000 7770:7770 --namespace memphis > /dev/null &

For interacting with the broker via HTTP:

  - kubectl port-forward service/memphis-rest-gateway 4444:4444 --namespace memphis > /dev/null &

Dashboard/CLI: http://localhost:9000
Broker: localhost:6666 (Client Connections)
REST Gateway: localhost:4444 (Data + Mgmt)
```

**For Production Environments**
Please expose the UI, Cluster, and Control-plane via k8s ingress / load balancer / nodeport

### Via Docker
```shell
Dashboard/CLI: http://localhost:9000
Broker: localhost:6666
```

## Beta
Memphis{dev} is currently in Beta version. This means that we are still working on essential features like real-time messages tracing, schema registry and inline processing as well as making more SDKs and supporting materials.

How does it affect you? Well... mostly it doesn't.<br>
(a) The core of memphis broker is highly stable<br>
(b) We learn and fix fast<br><br>
But we need your love, and any help we can get by stars, PR, feedback, issues, and enhancements.<br>
